## Health Insurance Analysis

This repository contains Python code for the analysis of health insurance data. The code loads and preprocesses the data, creates regression models, and optimizes hyperparameters to enhance the performance of the Gradient Boosting model. The final results, including the R-squared (RÂ²) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the optimized model, are displayed.

### Repository Contents
- `insurance.xlsx`: The health insurance data file in Excel format.
- `insurance_analysis.py`: The Python code with descriptive comments.
- `README.md`: This file containing information about the code.

### How to Use
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcguilherme/insurance-analysis.git

Install the necessary libraries (ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed):



pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Execute the code in a compatible Python environment. Follow the steps provided in the code to perform the analysis and hyperparameter optimization.

Code Details
The insurance_analysis.py code is well-documented with comments describing each step of the process, from data loading to hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation. The main models used include Linear Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

Results
The analysis results, including R-squared and MAE for the final model, are displayed in the code.
